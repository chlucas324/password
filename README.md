# Password Generator 

## Description

This web application uses JavaScript to generate a new password.  The user is presented with a series of prompts about password criteria (length, use of various characters (lowercase and upper case letters, numbers and special characters)).  Once prompts are answered, a password generates and is visible on the screen.  The HTML and CSS was provided as starter code prior to the start of this project.
